Brrr, skibidi bop bop dob yes yes
Skibidi W nim nim
Skibidi bop bop dob yes yes
Skibidi W nim nim
pre-chorus
We ain't here to hurt nobody
Skibidi, skibidi, skibidi
Wanna see you work your body
Skibidi, skibidi, skibidi
verse
When Timbo' is in the party
Everybody put up their hands
I get a half a mill' for my beats, you get a couple gra-a-and
Never gon' see the day that I ain't got the upper hand
I'm respected from Californ-I-A way down to Japan
I'm a real producer and you just a piano man
Your songs don't top the charts, I heard 'em, I'm not a fa-a-an
Niggas talkin' greasy, I'm the one that gave them they chance
Somebody need to tell 'em that they can't do it like I can
pre-chorus
If you see us in the club, we'll be acting real nice
If you see us on the floor, you'll be watching all night
We ain't here to hurt nobody
(So give it to me, give it to me, give it to me)
Wanna see you work your body
(So give it to me, give it to me, give it to me)
pre-chorus
If you see us in the club, we'll be acting real nice
If you see us on the floor, you'll be watching all night
We ain't here to hurt nobody
(So give it to me, give it to me, give it to me)
Wanna see you work your body
(So give it to me, give it to me, give it to me)
